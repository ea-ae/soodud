# soodud

Soodud is a webapp that scrapes data from online stores and uses C++ hierarchical cluster analysis to form comparable products between stores. The data is given by a Django REST API and then processed by a TailwindCSS & React frontend. CI/CD is implemented with Docker and static files are served by nginx.
